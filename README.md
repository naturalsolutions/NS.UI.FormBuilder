## Features

## Demo

You can try the formBuilder on [this page](http://naturalsolutions.github.io/NS.UI.FormBuilder/)
That page is static, so some functionnalities like "save on the cloud" will not work.

### Demo FormBuilder to Backbone forms

When you've imported a JSON file, you can try it on this page [FormBuilder to Backbone-forms](http://amiceli.github.io/FormBuilderToBBForms/).
You can generate a form with your jSON File.

##### Currently the FormBuilder is not 100% compatible with backbone forms but it's our goal.
